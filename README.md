# NFL Game Tracker

## Overview

This project is inspired by (and built in replacement of) the Bitcoin Ticker app that was built while following "The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp using Dart" by the London App Brewery and Angela Yu on LinkedIn Learning (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/flutter-part-09-dart-cupertino-and-widgets). By utilizing The Sports DB NFL api (https://www.thesportsdb.com/league/4391-NFL), this app tracks the upcoming NFL games.


## What was learned from the course

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revise previous concepts by completing the challenges (api driven applications).
